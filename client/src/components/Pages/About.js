            <h3>History and Future</h3>
            <p>
              This project is the fruition of a long-term goal within the spike
              sorting effort of CCM, starting in 2014 at what was then the SCDA.
              The original spike sorting effort comprised Jeremy Magland, Alex
              Barnett, and Leslie Greengard, and collaborators in Loren Frank's
              lab.
            </p>
            <p>
              Early design principles were outlined in our{' '}
              <a href="https://github.com/flatironinstitute/spikesortercomparison">
                white paper
              </a>{' '}
              of May 2018. This was inspired in part a spike-sorting community
              discussion at the Janelia spike sorting meeting of 3/22/18.
